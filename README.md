# SNHU-CS-465

# Architecture
# Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
The Angular project structure is more condensed than the Express HTML customer-facing page.  Since the SPA is meant for page administration, the goal is to show as much as possible for easy viewing and access.  The Express HTML page is intended to engage the end users.  This requires more blank space and engaging visuals, including the color scheme of the background.
# Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
MongoDB was used as the database to store the web app data due to its high performance and scalability.  

# Functionality
# How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON is a format for sharing data between systems and programming languages.  Javascript is a programming language used for full-stack web development.  JSON files are shared between the layers of the full-stack application.
# Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
The first instance of code refactoring in this project was to convert the headers and footers into partials to avoid code redundancies.

# Testing
# Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
Testing was completed through Postman and the localhost browser.  Security is not inherent in MEAN full-stack applications, so there must be an intentional effort to include secure coding standards in the project, including the user validations added to this project.

# Reflection
#  How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course has been very enlightening in terms of full-stack development, which is something that others in my current company do.  It has enabled me to be a better asset to my team in small ways.  I am excited for the second half of this project in the next full-stack course.
